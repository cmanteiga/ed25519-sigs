## Contributing

### Development

1. Install Node 8 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.
   Tests need to pass in Node 8 and 10.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.

When server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart
itself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev
server (`gatsby dev`) should also automatically reload. However the ed25519 signature
definitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,
either run `npm run defs` or manually restart the server.

To debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.
It also works with full URLs like
`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.

Use `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.
[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].

Ed25519-sigs has experimental support for [Gitpod][gitpod], a pre-configured development
environment that runs in your browser. To use Gitpod, click the button below and
sign in with GitHub. Gitpod also offers a browser add-on, though it is not required.
Please report any Gitpod bugs, questions, or suggestions in issue
[#2772](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/2772).

[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/badges/shields)

[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don't inadvertently make changes that affect the
SVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run
`SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:js:server` to preview changes to the saved
snapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:js:server` to update them.
